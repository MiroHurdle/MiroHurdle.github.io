          <h2>Mindfullness In Daily Life</h2>
          <h4> Mindfullness Conversation</h4>
          <p>
            I had a brief "mindfull" conversation with my friend the other day, and while I found the intentional listening to be effective and useful, going back and
            rehashing everything he said wasn't particularly enlightening. It may have been because our conversation wasn't very complex, but there wasn't anything I
            misunderstood to begin with. It was nice to intentionally speak to him and it was a good conversation but I think just being mindful of your own behavior
            during a conversation is the most important thing I took from this chapter.

          <h4>Mindfullness Techniques</h4>
          <p>
            I think the idea of practicing mindfullness while doing something pleasant sounded like it could be very effective, and I have been using this method while also
            practicing meditation in a more standard neutral setting. I think that using this combination keeps me from becoming bored with the practice allowing me to
            do more everyday than I otherwise would have. I liked the idea of being mindful during meals and have been doing that a lot recently as well. I also tried to 
            do the walking meditations although I am usually very distracted by my surroundings and didn't find it to be especially effective.
          </p>
          <h4>Other Musings</h4>
          <p>
              I have been enjoying my time practicing mindfullness and find it very useful for resetting my emotions and mental state. While I am not entirely convinced it
              can have all of the long term effects the author claims, I do believe that its a useful technique for short term happiness and well being. I have been struggling
              to make a habit of mindfullness, but I am slowly getting better at practicing multiple times a day even if its only for thirty seconds at a time.
