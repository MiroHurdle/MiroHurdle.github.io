          <h4> Grid Based Design</h4>
          <p>
              Grid based design is the method of designing a web page pased on rows and columns. By breaking the page
              down into rows with columns of various widths in each row, it is easy to lay out a simple, organized,
              and easily accessible website. Generally the grid is broken down in to 12 columns because 12 is an
              even number that can easily be broken down into halves, thirds, quartes or even sixths. It gives you
              most flexibility while still being wide enough to read text or other important information at its
              smallest denomination. With a fixed number of columns in each row it is easy to know how much space is 
              available and organize your page accordingly.
          </p>
          <h4>Responsive Webpages</h4>
          <p>
              Responsive webpages are increasingly important now that people are viewing online content using a number
              of devices with a wide variety of screen sizes. A responsive webpage is one that will adjust based on the
              size of the used window, so that you can view a full image without scrolling on a smartphone or a 27 inch desktop.
              This can take the form of resizing, hiding, or moving elements on the page so that it still looks good to
              the user no matter what device they are using. Responsive web design can be the difference between someone
              using your site or another better designed one with more functionality.
          </p>
          <h4> Semantic Structure</h4>
          <p>
              Semantic structure refers to the tags and syntax used in html. It is how your organize a webpage and decide what
              type of tag a given element should have. For instance often the title of the page would go under an h1 tag
              because it is bigger than the rest of the text, and it is one of the most general pieces of information on
              the page. The semantic structure dictates how the page looks and what elements appear where.
          </p>
          <h4>Thoughts and Reflections</h4>
          <p>
              After getting this far in the sprint I finally feel that I have a decent sense of how to build a moderately
              useful, accessible, and good looking webpage. Grid based design really helped me figure out how to lay out 
              my page in a way that I think looked good and actually behaved like I wanted it too. And having access to
              bootstrap was extremely useful even if I have barely scratched the surface of what it can do. I'm looking
              forward to understanding it better so that I can continue to work on this site and make it better and better.
