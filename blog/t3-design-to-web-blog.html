          <h2>Design to Web</h2>
          <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
          <p>
            Responsive design is one of the most important aspects of a website these days as there are so many different devices of various sizes used to browse the internet.
            It dictates how a page looks at any given screen size and which elements are resized, removed, or repositioned as the screen size changes. If you just took a website
            and only changed the size of the elements it would either require a whole lot of scrolling on a smart phone, or if it was only designed for phone use, it would look
            atrocious when viewed on a desktop. For this reason it is important to change how the site looks using "media queries". These check for the size of the screen used
            and implement different elements and designs to ensure the site is aesthetically pleasing and accessible for anyone using any device.
          </p>
          <h4>Mobile First Design</h4>
          <p>
              Mobile first design is the process of building a site that is first based for mobile users, and then adds more/different features as the screen size increases and more
              space becomes available. This is crucial because it means that when using a mobile phone, instead of loading the data for the site at full size and then only showing the
              elements meant for mobile, you only have to load exactly what you are looking at. Because people are often using data and not wifi when viewing sites on their phones, they
              often have a slower connection meaning mobile first designs load quicker. Additionally a lot of people have to pay per byte to use mobile data to access the web, so the
              less they have to use the cheaper it is for them to view your site.
          </p>
          <h4>Frameworks</h4>
          <p>
              Frameworks are essentially a package of written code that kind of acts as a language you can use within your own to more easily format your work. Instead of rewriting the code
              to format a site from scratch everytime, you can use a framework developed for someone else that can do a lot of the work for you. For instance the layout of this page was
              created using the skeleton framework. This framework is very lightweight, meaning its doesn't add a lot of unnecessary code to the page keeping the the whole thing really small.
              Because I am using this framework, I can use certain syntaxes to help me organize the page in the way that I want. These are often only a few lines of extra code, whereas if I wanted
              to achieve the same thing without the framework, I would have to write lines and lines of code so that the elements on the page conform to my idea of what they should look like.
              The downsides to using frameworks are that you have to learn the syntax of each one that you decied to use, and they can often add a considerable amount of size to your finished
              webpages. Additionally they don't solve all of your problems, so you will also have to write at least some of the code yourself.
          </p>
          <h4>Wireframes</h4>
          <p>
              Wireframes are rough outlines of what you want your site to look like. They can be used to give you an idea of what your site will look like when it is finished in terms of
              size and placement but not content. They are important to have, because you can use them to remember exactly how you wanted to format your page from the beginning. Also they
              can help you figure out which framework might be of the most use.
