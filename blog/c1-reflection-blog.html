          <h4>The EDA Experience </h4>
          <p>
              From what I have heard and experienced of EDA thus far I believe that above all else the program is about fostering the ability to build 
              and maintain positive working relationships. While I am aware that learning the material and putting in the time and effort to master
              the skills required to become a developer is the end result, it seems vital that the students build off one another's knowledge to achieve
              that goal. Understanding and empathizing with my peers appears to be vital to success at EDA and any work associated with coding and web
              development in general.
          </p>
          <p>
              I consider myself to be an amicable and non-judgemental person who can work with a wide variety of people regardless of background.
              On the other hand I often find it difficult to admit it when I don't understand something and often avoid asking for help to the
              detriment of myself and whatever project I am working on. It is an issue that I am trying to address and something that I must overcome
              if I am to do well at EDA. I ultimately believe that I will succeed and that the mentality of EDA will mesh well with my personality.
          </p>
          <p>
              I don't think my expectations of EDA have changed all that much thus far. Everything I have heard from various sources has been
              consistant with what I initially read and learned about the program. I am a little bit nervous about leaving the states and the heavy
              workload at the boot camp, but I am more excited than anything else. I believe I will fit in well at EDA and I am excited to meet new
              people and experienc new cultures. I have never consistantly worked 70 hour weeks and I believe it will be quite difficult for me but
              I am also ready to learn and move forward in the programming world and see where it takes me.
