          <h2>Basic Javascript</h2>
          <h4>Html, CSS, & Javascript</h4>
          <p>
            While html and css make up the content and layout of a webpage, javascript is responsible for all of the moving parts and pretty much any other interactive elements of the page.
            It is the most complex of the three languages and is much more powerful than the other two. Almost every time a user interacts with a webpage involves javascript. It can be used
            to create online browser games or special animations. Also most web apps are built with javascript.
          </p>
          <h4>Control FLow and Loops</h4>
          <p>
            Control flow is the order in which a javascript page is implemented. It can sort of be compared to the average day of a habitual human being. Generally, the flow starts at the top of
            the page and continues down until it reaches the end of the javascript code. So you can think of the very first command on the page as waking up. Each sequential action you take as you
            go about your day is like reaching the next line of code. Sometimes in javascript you get to a loop, in which a set of actions are repeated until an exit condition is met.
            YOu can think about this like going to the gym and lifting weights until you have completed 10 reps. In this case your exit condition was completing those 10 reps,
            but it could have been something different like lifting weights for running on a treadmill until your heart rate reached a certain number. Afterwards you continue on with your day much
            like the control flow will continue to the next line of code.
          </p>
          <h4>Arrays and Objects.</h4>
          <p>
            The main difference between accessing arrays vs objects is how you call their contents. To call a term in an array you use the name of the array and the number of its postion in square
            braces something like nameOfArray[4] where 4 is the 5th term in the array (the array indices start at 0). To call a term in an object you can use dot notation (object.trait) or bracket
            notatation (object[trait]) however instead of using indices you use properties given to the object. For instance the object could be a car with various information stored, like the color,
            model, gas milage, etc. If the name of the object was car and you wanted to find out its color, you could call car.color (as long as the property for color was given the name color).
          </p>
          <h4>Functions</h4>
          <p>
            Functions are comprised of code that performs a set of actions and often outputs a value. They often take one or more parameters and are very useful if they are performing actions that
            you need to do multiple times. When a function is called, it temporarily takes over the control flow, completes its code and returns the flow to the next line of code. Functions can be
            as simple as taking two numbers and adding them together, or quite complex using tens of lines of code, if not more. Once the function has been written, you only have to call it with its
            and parameters in order to use it again. This can save you from writing hundreds of lines of code.
