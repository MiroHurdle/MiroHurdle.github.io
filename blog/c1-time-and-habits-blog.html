          <h2>Thoughts and Experiences</h2>
          <p> While reading through the list of habits and productivity techniques there were a couple that stood out to me that I thought I would try.
              The first was the pomodoro technique. The idea of a fixed short time to work appealed to me as someone who often struggles
              to maintain concentration for long stretches. While I have only used this technique briefly, I can see it becoming an important
              part of my working routine. The five minute breaks every half hour are incredibly refreshing and are a great tool for helping
              me refocus on the task at hand. The second techinque I employed was brief meditation. I have tried mediation in the past and
              often I find it difficult to keep focused on what I am doing, whether its my breathing. My mind tends to wander and I return to
              focusing on my breathing or surroundings only sporadically for breif periods. I think with practice I will get better at keeping
              mindful and focused and am excited about the many benefits of regular meditation.
          </p>
          <p> I think the most interesting topic for me was the flow state. It is something I've read about in the past and have experienced
              on a few occasions. However, I always assumed it just happened from time to time, and that I was lucky to feel so productive.
              I was happy to learn about the things I can to do to increase the likelihood of entering the flow state. Though I haven't had success
              thus far in achieving flow using these techniques, I look forward to getting there in the near future. Along with mediation, achieving
              the flow state is the habit that I will be trying to form over the next couple of months.
