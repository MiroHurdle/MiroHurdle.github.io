          <h2>Self Confidence</h2>
          <h4> Mindfullness and Self Awareness</h4>
          <p>
             Mindfullness and self awareness are actually fairly closely related. Both require intentional and focused self reflection and practicing mindfullness can lead
             to better self awareness. To be truly self aware its necessary to go further than just "insight into ones moment to moment emotional experience" as our author
             puts it. Instead you must develop your emotional intelligence and fully understand your strengths and weaknesses. Both self awareness and mindfullness can help to build
             self confidence and happiness.

          <h4>Body Scan</h4>
          <p>
             I tried the body scan technique mentioned by the autor and while I didn't find it as useful as he described but it was quite relaxing. He spoke of trying to find emotion
             in the body and I couldn't sense that at all. Perhaps with more practice I will be better able to reap the benefits of body scan, but for now its just another form of
             meditation. It was also difficult for me to pinpoint exactly where any given feeling was comming from. Iv'e never noticed this in the past but unless I have a specific
             point of physical pain or irritation (a bug bit or visible scratch) I can only find a general area from which the feeling comes. I'm hoping to improve my 
             ability in this regard by practicing the body scan technique.
          </p>
          <h4>My Emotions Aren't Me</h4>
          <p>
            The idea behind the concept of "my emotions aren'me" is to get away from the idea that our emotions control us to a place where they are just something we notice and 
            experience. I have heard variations of this idea in the past and was never super impressed with the idea, although I do think that mastery of emotions is important,
            especially for some people who experience feel strong emotions and act on them impulsively. I know this happens to everyone from time to time but I feel like its 
            a pretty rare occurence. I find that if I can understand that I am angry, not why or how, just that I am feeling angry, I can remain calm and civil even if I still feel
            angry. I guess that is a kind of very basic version of this concept, and I'm sure it would be helpful if I got better at it, but I don't see it as something truly
            necessary to becoming a happier better person.
