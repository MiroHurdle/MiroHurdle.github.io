          <h2>Meditation and  Processes</h2>
          <h4> Process over Product</h4>
          <p>
            Honestly I struggled with this a little bit. I am still getting the hang of media queries and at the moment I don't really like the way my site looks,
            especially when shifting from one size threshold to another. I understand that I am still learning but I'm not a fan of struggling to figure out exactly how
            my website should look both in my mind and in reality. I think that part of my frustration comes from having this particular sprint stretch over quite some 
            time as I have not had much time to work on it at all. Despite my frustrations however, I think I understand the core of proccess over product, and it gets
            easier to deal with as I learn more about web design, and can implement more and more elements into my website.

          <h4>SIYS Chapter 2; Before and After</h4>
          <p>
              My idea of meditation didn't change a lot before and after reading the second chapter. Based on the first chapter and my own prior knowledge of meditation
              I was already convinced of the benefits, and understood that it was something I was interested in trying. I did enjoy that the author cites a number of modern
              studies on the effects of meditation on western society. I was also taken by the idea that happiness is the base state, and that its all of the "sediment" in our
              minds that can lead us away from being content. While I'm not sure I believe this, its an interesting concept and I would like to discover for myself whether or 
              not its true. The other big idea that I took away from this chapter is that its ok that my mind wanders from time to time. The act of consciously bring my attention
              back to my breathing is as important as concentrating on breathing in the first place. Or as the book put it, developing both attention and meta-attention.

          <h4>Meditation Techniques & Other Musings</h4>
          <p>
              I think the technique of sitting like a mountain stood out the most to me. While I'm not sure its the best method for me personally, i enjoyed the image and I can
              imagine that it could be very effective for some. I also enjoyed the way the author described "letting go" as inviting a distraction to leave, but being ok if it stayed.
              Its a passive approach to dealing with any issues you may come across while meditating and it promotes acceptance which I believe is incredibly important.
              I quite enjoyed chapter two of SIYS and I really enjoy the laid back way the author has of introducing meditation and mindfulness to his readers. In part I think
              this is because he is aware of the skepticism that a lot of western civilization has for eastern practices, especially when they are preached by people who seem zealous
              in their beliefs. Instead he promotes meditation with scientific sources, and a loose set of guidelines to follow which is most likely be very effective.
