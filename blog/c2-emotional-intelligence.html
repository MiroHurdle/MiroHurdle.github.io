          <h2>Learning</h2>
          <p>
              While reading the first chapter of Search Inside Yourself, I think the biggest takeaway for me was that mindfullness and Emotional
              intelligence can be learned and aren't just skills that someone may or may not have. It is comforting to know that I can improve in these
              areas with time and practice and I am excited to begin doing so. I also liked the author's approach to happiness as I find it easy to 
              confuse moments of happiness with being in a happy and healthy place in everyday life. I realize that I am not particularly
              good at recognizing my own emotions unless they are particularly strong, and am now trying to evaluate how I am feeling more regularly
              to try and notice any changes in my emotional state. 
          </p>
          <h2>Two Minutes of Mindfullness</h2>
          <p>
              I've been enjoying my 2 minutes of mindfullness. Its something that I have been doing semi regularly since reading about meditation
              in sprint-1 and although I find it difficult to keep my mind on my breathing without wandering, it is getting a little easier each time
              I try it. These two minutes serve as a sort of soft reset on whatever I'm doing at the moment. I often find that I can refocus on a task
              that I had been struggling to keep my mind on before. It keeps my mind on what I am supposed to be doing and makes getting my work done a lot more
              pleasant. I think I am going to try to increase the time that I spend in conscious mindfullness as its a very peaceful moment in a usually
              hectic day.
