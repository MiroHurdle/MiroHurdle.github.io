    <h1>Html CSS & DOM</h1>
    <h2>The html Analogy </h2>
    <p>
        You can sort of view the process of building a webpage like that of making a clay vase on a pottery wheel. The html is like the
        physical structure of the vase that you sculpt on the wheel. You have some flexibility with the shape of the vase
        but ultimately what makes it unique and beautiful is the glaze that you put on it after its been fired. The glaze then is kind of
        like the CSS. It allows you to customize your vase the way you want with the designs and patterns of your choosing. While the shape
        the vase is essential, the glaze changes it from a functional but dull product into something beautiful. The DOM can be compared
        the kiln. It takes the vase that you have shaped and glazed and sets it into something useable. 
    </p>
    <h2> Boxifying Design </h2>
    <p>
        Everything that you see on a web page is ultimately a box, so an easy way of breaking down a website model into its component parts
        is to visualize boxes around the various parts of the model. For instance if there is a large block of text or an image you could
        draw a box around it. Then when you have boxed every element of the design you can work on them one at a time in your html and css files.
    </p>
    <h2> The Box Model</h2>
    <p>
        The box model refers to the fact that everything on a web page is a box inside of a larger box. The term box model is associated
        with the design and layout of a website, and for instance the CSS box model refers to a box around some html content that is in charge
        of the how that html code is presented on the actual web page. It is responsible for the margins, padding color and, font, and many other
        aspects of its given bit of content.
